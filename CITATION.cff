  The erlab package provides a complete python workflow for ARPES (Angle-Resolved
  Photoemission Spectroscopy) experiments. It provides a wide range of tools for
  processing, analyzing, and visualizing ARPES data, mainly focused on highly efficient
  GUI tools. Most analysis routines make minimal assumptions about the data, allowing
  users to apply their own analysis methods.
