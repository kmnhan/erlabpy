Getting Started
***************

Welcome to ERLabPy! This documentation will guide you through the installation process
and provide an overview of the package.

If you are new to programming with python, `Scientific Python Lectures
<https://github.com/jrjohansson/scientific-python-lectures>`_ is a great place to start.

Data structures in ERLabPy are represented using `xarray <https://docs.xarray.dev/>`_\
:cite:p:`hoyer2017xarray`, which provides a powerful data structure for working with
multi-dimensional arrays. Check out the `xarray tutorial <https://tutorial.xarray.dev/>`_
and the `xarray user guide <https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/index.html>`_ to get
familiar with xarray.

Installing
==========

The recommended way to install ERLabPy is via conda. If you do not have conda installed,
follow the :ref:`installation instructions <Installing conda>`. Once you have a working
conda environment, you can install ERLabPy with the conda command line tool: ::

  conda install -c conda-forge erlab

.. hint::

  If you are using macOS, you might experience degraded performance with the
  default BLAS and LAPACK libraries. For Apple Silicon macs, use `Accelerate
  <https://developer.apple.com/accelerate/>`_: ::

    conda install "libblas=*=*accelerate"

  For Intel macs, use `MKL
  <https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/onemkl.html>`_:
  ::

    conda install "libblas=*=*mkl"

  To prevent conda from switching back to the default libraries, see the
  `conda-forge documentation
  <https://conda-forge.org/docs/maintainer/knowledge_base/#switching-blas-implementation>`_.

If you donâ€™t use conda, you can install ERLabPy with pip: ::

  python -m pip install erlab

Optional dependency groups can be installed with the following commands: ::

  python -m pip install erlab[viz]       # Install optional dependencies for visualization
  python -m pip install erlab[perf]      # Install optional dependencies for performance
  python -m pip install erlab[misc]      # Install miscellaneous optional dependencies
  python -m pip install erlab[complete]  # Install all optional dependencies

If you wish to install ERLabPy from source, see the :doc:`contributing`.

Importing
=========

Once installed, you can import ERLabPy in your Python scripts or interactive sessions.

The following import conventions are recommended for ERLabPy modules: ::

  import erlab.analysis as era
  import erlab.interactive as eri
  import erlab.io
  import erlab.plotting.erplot as eplt

Along with frequently used modules, your import statements may look like this: ::

  import erlab.analysis as era
  import erlab.interactive as eri
  import erlab.io
  import erlab.plotting.erplot as eplt
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
  import numpy as np
  import xarray as xr

  xr.set_options(keep_attrs=True)

Of course, you may not need all of these modules for every script.

.. note::

  The interactive plotting module, :mod:`erlab.interactive`, requires a Qt library such
  as PyQt6 or PySide6. If you do not have one installed, ERLabPy will notify you when
  you try to import the module.

Dependencies
============

ERLabPy is installed with many different python libraries.

The following table lists some of the most important packages that ERLabPy depends on
that are used in various fields of the scientific python ecosystem. Links to their
documentation are listed below as a reference.

.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1
    :stub-columns: 1
    :widths: auto

    * - Package
      - Used in
    * - `numpy <https://numpy.org/doc/stable/>`_
      - Computation and array manipulation, linear algebra
    * - `xarray <https://docs.xarray.dev/>`_
      - Data storage and manipulation
    * - `matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org>`_
      - Plotting
    * - `scipy <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/index.html>`_
      - Linear algebra, signal processing, and image processing
    * - `lmfit <https://lmfit.github.io/lmfit-py/>`_
      - Optimization problems including curve fitting

For interactive plotting, a Qt library such as PyQt6 or PySide6 is required. To ensure
compatibility and keep the namespace clean, ERLabPy imports Qt bindings from `qtpy
<https://github.com/spyder-ide/qtpy>`_, which will automatically select the appropriate
library based on what is installed.

See the :doc:`user-guide/index` to start using ERLabPy!

.. _optional dependencies:

Optional dependencies
---------------------

The following packages are optional dependencies that are not installed by default. They
are only used in specific functions, or is not used at all but is listed just for
convenience.

.. list-table::

    :stub-columns: 1
    :widths: auto

    * - Package
      - Description
    * - `csaps <https://github.com/espdev/csaps>`_
      - Multidimensional smoothing splines
    * - `ipywidgets <https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets>`_
      - Interactive widgets
    * - `hvplot <https://github.com/holoviz/hvplot>`_ and `bokeh

        `cmocean <https://matplotlib.org/cmocean/>`_, and
        `colorcet <https://colorcet.holoviz.org>`_
      - More colormaps!

For a full list of dependencies and optional dependencies, take a look at the
``[project]`` and ``[project.optional-dependencies]`` section in `pyproject.toml
<https://github.com/kmnhan/erlabpy/blob/main/pyproject.toml>`_:

.. literalinclude:: ../../pyproject.toml
   :language: toml
   :start-at: dependencies = [
   :end-before: [project.urls]


Notes on compatibility
----------------------

- ERLabPy supports Python 3.11 and later.
- There are some `known compatibility issues
  <https://github.com/kmnhan/erlabpy/issues/17>`_ with PyQt5 and PySide2, so it is
  recommended to use the newer PyQt6 or PySide6 if possible.
- If you meet any unexpected behaviour while using IPython's `autoreload extension
  <https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config/extensions/autoreload.html>`_, try
  excluding the following modules: ::

    %aimport -erlab.io.dataloader -erlab.accessors
