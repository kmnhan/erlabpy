A library that provides a set of tools and utilities to handle, manipulate, and
visualize data from condensed matter physics experiments, with a focus on
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES).

*ERLabPy* is built on top of the popular scientific python libraries `numpy
<https://numpy.org>`_, `scipy <https://scipy.org>`_, and `xarray
<https://xarray.pydata.org>`_, and is designed to be easy to use and integrate with
existing scientific Python workflows so that you can quickly get started with your data
analysis. The package is still under development, so if you have any questions or
suggestions, please feel free to contact us. We hope you find ERLabPy useful for your
research!
